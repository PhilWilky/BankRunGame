//GOAL:
    //I am trying to make a simple tycoon type game based off of the first Goldsmith banker of the 1600s.I don't yet have a game loop
    //but i have gold in a vault that can be used to issue promissory notes, i know the bankers of the time gave out more notes than they
    //had gold bars in their vault. can you help me with ideas.


 //SOME IDEAS:
    //Create a system for issuing promissory notes: In your game, players should be able to issue promissory notes using the gold in their vault.
    //You could make it so that players have to pay interest on the notes they issue, and if they can't pay back the notes, their reputation
    //with other bankers and merchants will suffer.

    //Introduce risk and uncertainty: In the 1600s, the banking industry was inherently risky, and your game should reflect that.
    //You could introduce random events that affect the value of gold or the demand for promissory notes, and players would need to adjust
    //their strategies accordingly.

    //Implement competition: The banking industry is competitive, and your game should reflect that too.
    //You could introduce other bankers as AI opponents or have players compete against each other to see who can accumulate the most wealth and prestige.

    //Introduce historical accuracy: Since your game is based on the Goldsmith banker of the 1600s,you could introduce some historical accuracy
    //to the game. For example, players could face restrictions on the amount of gold they could hold, or they might face consequences
    //if they issued too many promissory notes.

    //Implement a feedback system: Players should receive feedback on their performance in the game, such as how much interest they're earning or
    //how their reputation is affected by their actions. This feedback system can help players make better decisions and adjust their strategies
    //accordingly.

    //Overall, these are just a few ideas to help you get started. As you develop your game further,
    //you can continue to refine and tweak these systems to create a fun and engaging tycoon experience.
